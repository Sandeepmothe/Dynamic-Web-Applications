## ðŸ”§ JavaScript DOM Features

In this project, I practiced **DOM manipulation** using JavaScript to make the webpage interactive.

### âœ… What I implemented:
- Used `getElementById`
- Dynamically updated content and styles
- Handled user events like clicks for menu navigation
- Improved user experience with responsive interactions

This helped me understand how to control and update webpage content using JavaScript in real-time.
